# 🧠 DSA Practice by Rakshith D N

Welcome to my DSA Practice Repository! 
Here, I upload solutions to various **Data Structures and Algorithms** problems I solve on platforms like **LeetCode and GFG**.

## ✍️ Naming Convention

### ✅ LeetCode:
Each folder is named as:
7-Reverse-Integer

Each folder contains:
- 🔹 README.md file containg description of problem
- 🔹 Solution code (`.cpp`)

### ✅ GFG:
- Files are named like `Reverse_Array.cpp`, `Kth_Largest_Element.cpp`, etc.


## 💡 Topics Covered

✅ Arrays  
✅ Strings  
✅ Linked Lists  
✅ Recursion  
✅ Stack & Queue  
✅ Trees  
✅ Binary Search  
✅ Dynamic Programming  
✅ Graphs (coming soon)


## 🚀 How to Use

- Explore by topic folders
- View `.cpp` files to see code + inline comments
- New problems added weekly!
